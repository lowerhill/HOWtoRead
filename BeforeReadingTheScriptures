찬송 85장 by Wesley 

Before reading the Scriptures
성경을 읽기 전에 

1	Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire,	 	1	
 	Let us thine influence prove,	 	2	
 	Source of the old prophetic fire,	 	3	
 	Fountain of life and love.	 	4	
2	Come, Holy Ghost (for moved by thee	 	5	
 	The prophets wrote and spoke);	(2 Pet. 1:21)	6	
 	Unlock the truth, thyself the key,	 	7	
 	Unseal the sacred book.	(Isa. 29:11; Rev. 5:9)	8	
3	Expand thy wings, celestial dove,	(Gen. 1:2-4)	9	
 	Brood o'er our nature's night;	 	10	
 	On our disordered spirits move,	 	11	
 	And let there now be light.	 	12	
4	God through himself we then shall know,	(1 Cor. 2:11; 2 Cor. 4:6)	13	
 	If thou within us shine;	 	14	
 	And sound, with all thy saints below,	(Eph. 3:18)	15	
 	The depths of love divine.	 	16
